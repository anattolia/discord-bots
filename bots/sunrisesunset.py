Here is a short poem about the beginning of a new day.

I'll tell you how the sun rose, â€”
A ribbon at a time.
The steeples swam in amethyst,
The news like squirrels ran.

The hills untied their bonnets,
The bobolinks begun.
Then I said softly to myself,
"That must have been the sun!"

Here is a short poem about the beginning of a new day.

Dawn
Is beautiful.
Its new and raw.
It's beautifully honest.
There's something redeeming
about the early minutes our day
It imitates the early minutes of our existence
And erodes the nonsense and lies
Of day-to-day survival.

Here is a short poem about the beginning of a new day.

Long before the postman comes
The sun begins to rise,
Far in the East if you should look
You'd find it in the skies.
At first it's just a streak of light
Then all at once the world gets bright.

Here is a short poem about the sunset.

Out of the sunset's red
Into the blushing sea,
The winds of day drop dead
And dreams come home to me.
The sea is still, and apart
Is a stillness in my heart.

Here is a short poem about the sunset.

It is a beauteous evening, calm and free,
The holy time is quiet as a Nun
Breathless with adoration; the broad sun
Is sinking down in its tranquility;
The gentleness of heaven broods oâ€™er the Sea

Here is a short poem about the sunset.

The sun's still keeping the sky
somewhat colored,
even though it's already gone down
beyond the horizon.
